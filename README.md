# Todoapp-V1
I created this app after getting to lecture 100 on my react js course. I wanted something simple which has some usability in the real world but can also test what I've learned so far. The todo app uses has features such as creating a todo item (With basic form checking) and then displaying it. Todo items can then be deleted or updated. This website could be greatly improved if it also utilized a backend and allowed users to register/login and saves todos. This is something I plan to implement in the future which will be Todoapp-V2(or greater number).
